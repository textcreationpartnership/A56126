         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F thou art ſo far come into the moderation, as to try all things, and hold faſt that which is of God, ſtand ſingle in that which is pure, and try not the truth in a ballance of deceit, for that which is of God muſt be tryed by ſomething of himſelf; the light of the body is the eye: If thou deny the light, with what wilt thou ſee? the natural cannot diſcern the ſpiritual, neither can the darkneſs comprehend the light, but the light the darkneſs. Now if thou wilt try that which is good, let the light of Chriſt in thy conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence judge, for that I own to be a meaſure of the true light, which lighteneth every man that cometh into the world; if thou deny this true light, thou denieſt the life of Chriſt, and art in death and darkneſs, and cannot receive the things of God; if thou receive them not, here thou mayeſt ſee what hinders: but otherwiſe, if thou confeſs that Jeſus Chriſt is come a light into the world, a light to lighten the Gentiles, and if thou believe that in the firſt nature thou art a Gentile, and cannot witneſs the new nature, wilt thou deny the gift of God, which is given thee to open the blind eye, to lead thee out of the priſon of corruption, into the new nature. If thou denyeſt this light, thou denyeſt the way, the truth, and the life, and haſt left thy ſelf without all help of recovery, ſo thy damnation is of thy ſelf; <hi>You will not come unto me that you may have life,</hi> ſaith he. Now if thou canſt believe that in the Son is life, turn to him, that thou mayeſt have life; and if thou believest the Scripture, that the life is the light of men, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it, and believe in it, that thou mayeſt be a child of light; for this I ſay, and ſtand a witneſs for the Lord, that if ever thou find him, who is the deſire of all Nations, it muſt be by a meaſure of himſelf made manifeſt in thee; therefore delay not as thou pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeſt thy pretious ſoul, but ſeek him while the may be found, for in
<pb facs="tcp:103344:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>the grave there is no remembrance of him, to day hear his voice, then harden not thy heart, but turn at his reproof; that which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves thee in ſecret, and makes manifeſt all thy evil deeds, that is the light which leads out of ſin and evil, this is the voice which ſaith behind thee, <hi>This is the way walk in it;</hi> therefore ſee thou refuſe not him that ſpeaketh, but turn at his reproof, that he may pour out his ſpirit upon thee: contrarywiſe, if thou wilt not ſtand in his counſel, but hate his reproof, thou mayeſt call, but he will not anſwer, thou mayeſt ſeek early, but thou ſhalt not find, thou mayest ſtrive, but ſhalt not be able to enter; and being with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, art among the dogs, ſorcerers, whore-mongers, murtherers, ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters, and lyars, which have their portion in the lake for ever and ever. It is the Nations of them which are ſaved, that walk in the light of the Lamb; theſe do his commandements, that they may have right to the tree of life; theſe that walk in the light, are they that enter through the gate into the City. Now if thou ſayeſt in thy ſelf, that thou haſt witneſſed an entrance already, how cameſt thou in? art thou one of the ſaved Nations, that walks in the light of the new Jeruſalem? canſt thou truly ſay that Jeſus Christ hath perfectly wrought his work in thee, which he came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world to finiſh, (that is) to put an end to ſin, and bring in perfect righteouſneſs? If this be wrought in thee, thou art righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, <hi>as he is righteous, for he that ſanctifieth, and they that are ſanctified, are all of one;</hi> and if thou art one with Chriſt, thou art a new creature, created unto good works, which is the fruit whereby thou art known from the world, for thou art not of the world that witneſſeth redemption out of the vain converſation, for the worlds fruits whereby they are known, is the vain conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation; thou that haſt an eye to ſee, thou mayeſt ſee; if theſe marks of a Chriſiian be found in thee, I own thee, and am one with thee in the life of Chriſt; but if on the contrary, the worlds marks do appear in thee, I deny thee, and all thy profeſſion and ſervice is an abomination in the ſight of the Lord, for thou profeſſeſt what thou art not, and ſo art a hypocrite, blaſpheming the Name of Chriſt, in ſaying thou art a Chriſtian, being found one of the Synagogue of Satan. Therefore friend, whoever thou art, to whom theſe papers ſhall come, be not prejudiced against the truth before thou haſt heard it, firſt read, and then judge, try the matter
<pb facs="tcp:103344:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>before thou paſſeſt ſentence, be ſure it be in the cool of the day, for this know, and I bear teſtimony to the truth hereof, that herein is the pure way of God declard, in which the holy men of God did walk, which the Prophets propheſied of, and the Apoſtles walked in, which way is Chriſt, the light of life, who is come and hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us an underſtanding to know him that is true, and his way which is pure, and his life which is perfect, the end of our faith, and ſalvation of our ſouls, and knowing the Lord, and his way, and his indignation against ſin and wickedneſs, cannot but deal plainly with all people, judging and condemning onely the deceit and deceivable wayes which leads to deſtruction; if thou ſay moſt Sects and Judgements will plead for their own, I ſay we are not our own, but anothers, who hath bought us with his blood, and for him we plead, and for his pure life contend, held by the myſtery of faith in a pure conſcience, once delivered to the Saints, for which we are bold to contend, and valiant to go forth to battel, by his command, under his banner, to fight againſt the Beaſt and all his Army, <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog;</hi> which battel ſhall never end till the Lamb hath got the victory, and all his enemies brought under his feet, for now is he riſen in his Saints, and glorified in his ſervants, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired in them that believe; yea, I bear teſtimony to the truth, and witneſs the glory of his power revealed in me, (praiſes, praiſes to his name for ever) therefore do deny all the worlds glory and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, pleaſure and profit, and eſteem it great riches to be worthy to ſuffer perſecution and reproach with his dear people, who are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viled of the world, and ſcornfully called Quakers, but known to me by another name, and I to them by the ſame, but to the world by</p>

All the Children of God who are born from above, they bear Gods Image and are like unto their father, as the Lord is righteous and juſt, and loves truth and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and cannot behold (but hates) iniquity; even ſo all his children they are pure and loves truth and righteouſneſs, and cannot have fellowſhip with the unfruitful workers of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; but it is a burden and a grief to be in company with the

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:103344:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>to be a Chriſtian is to be like unto Chriſt, and to follow him in the ſame ſteps; and ſo thoſe whom Chriſt ſends forth into the world he firſt ſanctifies, them by his living Word in their hearts, and ſo ſends them forth as lambs in the midſt of wolves; lambs becauſe of their harmleſsneſs and meekneſs, and being ſent among wolves, that is, among men in the nature of wolves, tearing and rending, haling and perſecuting, envying and full of rage, ready to ſwallow up the innocent ones: and this is made manifeſt at this day in <hi>England,</hi> the Lord is making a ſeparation, and gathering his lambs from among the devouring wolves, and they ſhall no more be made a prey upon, but the Lord will compaſs them about with the arm of his power, and ſalvation ſhall be for walls and for bull-warks, he will feed them himſelf as a good ſhepherd upon the tops of the mountains of Iſrael, and they ſhall dwell in peace and ſafety, and eat plenteouſly and be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, and they ſhall no more go among the broken ciſterns that will hold no water, but the living ſprings, and the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of life ſhall be opened in them; and they ſhall hunger and thirſt no more, and the Lord will be the teacher and feeder of his people, and will dwell in them and walk in them, and they ſhall worſhip him in his own Temple not made with mens hands, but his people are his Temple, whom he is now purifying and cleanſing, that it may be a holy ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation for his pure preſence to dwell in: ſo theſe are the true Chriſtians, who are in Chriſt, who are waſhed and cleanſed in his blood, who are new creatures, old things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing done way, and all things become new, their bodies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made Temples of God, where holineſs and purity dwells; and you who ſay you are Chriſtians, but are not in Chriſt, neither are waſhed nor cleanſed, but have on the old gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and the old things are not done away, but the heart is full of the old ſtuffe, as envy, wrath, malice, pieviſhneſs and perverſneſs, croſsneſs, ſtubborneſs, wilfulneſs, when things fals croſſe to your wills, then anger and paſſion ariſes, and ſo the old man is alive, and the old garments are on: theſe are the tokens and marks of a Heathen.

But all they who are profeſſed Chriſtians in <hi>England</hi> and other parts, who have gotten the words of the true Chriſtians, and are guilded over with glorious words, and makes a fair ſhew outwardly, as though they were a a people that did delight in the Commandements of God, yet the new life of a Chriſtian is not brought forth amongſt them, as was in the followers of Chriſt, but the old life of the Heathens is in them, old heart, old mind, old love, old

                  <note place="margin">Col. 2.14.

<note place="margin">Iſ. 66.1, 2, 3.

               <p>Chriſt Jeſus the beloved Son of God, gave forth many precepts and commands, all which we dearly own in their time and place: but one command that he gave forth is chiefly to be obſerved above all others,
<note place="margin">John 15.12. Joh. 13.34, 35</note> and that is, to <hi>love one another;</hi> this is an enduring and a ſubſtantial command, and not to be neglected, for this is a true token and mark where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the children of God are known from others; as it is written, <hi>Hereby ſhall all men know that ye are my Diſciples, if ye love one another:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joh. 4.7.</note> this command of love is the old com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, which was in the beginning, and it is the new commandement which <hi>John</hi> the beloved Diſciple doth ſo much preſs unto, ſaying, <hi>Beloved, let us love one another, for God is love, and every one that loveth is born of God, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth God; he that loveth not, knowes not God, for God is love: Beloved, if God ſo loved us, we ought alſo to love one another,</hi> 1 Joh. 4.</p>
               <p>Love endures for ever,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 13.</note> and without love all preaching, praying, reading, ſinging, and all other the Ordinances of God, are in vain; this is the chief thing <hi>(love)</hi> which is

<note place="margin">Mat. 24.12.</note> and that is the cauſe of all theſe diviſions and diſtractions, and wrangling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Religion, it is want of true love; For where the love of God is ſhed abroad in the hearts of his people, it links and joynes them together in one love, and life,
<note place="margin">Joh. 27.21, 22 Acts 4 32.</note> and pure way, and one ſpiritual worſhip, and all ſtrife, and contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and wrangling ceaſeth, and ſo they are all of one heart and mind, and one faith (which we own) which works by love,

                  <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.6.</p>
               <p>Another command Chriſt gave forth, which is not to be neglected by any of his, and that is this; <hi>Whatſoever ye would that men ſhould do unto you, do ye likewiſe unto them;</hi> this is an enduring and ſubſtantial command, and ought duly to be obſerved, <hi>for this is the Law and the Prophets,</hi> and this command we own, and teach people to obſerve, and many others there be of like force and effect, and ought not to be neglected, as <hi>if any on ſmite thee on the one cheek,

<note place="margin">1 Per. 3.4. Pſal. 51.6.</note> which is truth in the inward parts, to ſerve the Lord in truth and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes all the dayes of our lives) we own and practice;

<note place="margin">1 Pet. 3.21.</note> which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the profeſſers in <hi>England</hi> do ſo much idolize and cry up (though the weightier matters be neglected) we are dead with Chriſt from ſuch weak elements,

And this was that bread of life which the Saints did feed on, and the Communion-Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble where they did eat together in ſingleneſs of heart, as it is declared and teſtified in the Scriptures.

               <p>
                  <hi>The cup of bleſſing which we bleſs, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? the bread which we break, is it not the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the body of Chriſt? for we being many are one bread and one body, for we are all partakers of that one bread.</hi> This bread and this cup are not carnal and viſible, but ſpiritual in invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible: This bread is Chriſt; for ſaith he, <hi>I am the bread of life, I am the living bread that came down from above,

               <p>Chriſt Jeſus is called by ſeveral names in the Scriptures; and they who have the names but not the ſubſtance, are in confuſion and deviſion, and falls out about the names, and ſo runs into the outward which are but the ſhadowes, but knows not the life and ſubſtance.
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.14. John 6.35. John 8.12.</note> He who is called the <hi>bread of life,</hi> the ſame is called <hi>the Light of the World, who doth enlighten every one that cometh into the World;</hi>

<note place="margin">1 John 1.7.</note> and are all made partakers of that one light, and ſo of that one bread which is the Saints life,
<note place="margin">1 Tim. 3.16.</note> which is ſpiritual and a miſtery, hidden from the world, and from all worldly wiſdom,

               <p>And as for the outward water, it is but a figure of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving water within, which waſheth and cleanſeth the heart, which the outward water doth not.
<note place="margin">Heb. 10.22. Epheſ. 4.5. Mat. 3.11.</note> As for the one Baptiſm I own, which is the Baptiſm of Chriſt <hi>with the holy Ghoſt and with fire,</hi> which the water Baptiſm was but a figure of; and in denying the outward water Baptiſm, it is no breach of Chriſts Commands;
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.17.</note> 
                  <hi>for I was not ſent to Baptize but to preach the Goſpel:</hi> And all you who take upon you that power, I
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:103344:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>demand of you, who gave you commiſſion to go and Baptize with outward water; if you take your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion from the letter, without a lively commiſſion from Chriſt, I deny your ground and your commiſſion;
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3.11.</note> for it is not the letter of the Law of God that doth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power any one to execute the Law of God, neither doth the letter of the Goſpel impower any one to go and preach the Goſpel, though they be never ſo skilful and expert in the knowledge of the Scripture, without pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er from on high to commiſſion and impower them; no more then the letter of the Law of <hi>England</hi> doth impower any one to be a juſtice of peace to execute the Law, though many may buy the letter of the Law, and may be expert and skilful: Yet if the earthly powers do not give them commiſſion, they cannot act as a juſtice, nor execute the Law; if they ſhould take upon them ſuch a thing, the powers of the earth would, call them into queſtion: Even ſo all you who have taken upon you that power to baptize without commiſſion from the Lord, aſſure your ſelves you will be called into queſtion: and in the Name of my Lord and Maſter, I do charge you to give an account who it was that gave you commiſſion; and ceaſe ſpeaking againſt others, (who keep the commands of God) whom you cannot accuſe juſtly for breach of the holy and pure ſubſtantial commands.</p>

<note place="margin">Rom 8.26.27. 1 Cor. 2.10.</note> 
                  <hi>we know not what to pray for as we ought, but the ſpirit helpeth our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, and makes interceſſion for us with ſighs and groans that cannot be uttered; for it is the ſpirit that makes manifeſt, and ſearcheth out the deep and hidden things of God;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">John 4.24.</note> for as <hi>God is a ſpirit, and will be worſhipped in ſpirit;</hi> ſo there is none knowes him nor worſhips him in ſpirit,

               <p>Stand upon your watch, and bring your deeds to the light, that ſo they may be proved and tryed whether or no they be wrought in God, for he that walks in the light is kept from ſtumbling. But all careleſs and ſlothful neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent ones, who run head-long (raſhly) without conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration or tryal of their deeds, are captivated and enſnared by the temptation of the devil, and ſo the light follows them, and is their condemnation, and ſo trouble and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery comes upon the wicked, and it is juſt, for he is the fool whoſe eyes be abroad, and whoſe tongue is at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and ſo the rod is prepared for the back of the ſool: Therefore weigh your words in the juſt ballance, and be well adviſed before you act any thing, firſt try the motion, before you go on to action: for in all words and actions, whatſoever any one doth either act or ſpeak, there is ſome thing within that moves before the action bee acted, or words be ſpoken, and whether it be good or evil, it comes from within, out of the heart, and as is the heart, ſo will the words and actions be; if the heart be evil, the words and actions will be evil; and if the heart be good and pure, the words and actions will be likewiſe good and pure. Now come all to the touch-ſtone, and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:103344:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>to the ground of all things, that you may know the ground of good things, and the ground of evil things; for as God is the Author of all good, ſo the Devil is the Author of all evil: and as God is a pure Spirit, and works in a miſtery in the hearts of the children of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, working them into his Image and likeneſſe to do his works, which are works of righteouſneſſe; ſo the devil is an unclean and a dark ſpirit, and works in a miſtery in the hearts of the children of diſobedience, working them into his Image and likeneſſe, to do his works, which are works of unrighteouſneſſe: And as the Author of good, and the Author of evil are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary one to the other, and no fellowſhip betwixt them; ſo the workers and ſervants of each of theſe, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary one to the other, and no agreement amongſt them, but a ſtrong and an irreconcileable enmity; and ſo a great and ſtrong battel: and this battel is begun in this Nation (and other parts) the great and mighty battel between the Prince of light, and the Prince of darkneſs, (between the raging Beaſt, and the meek and harmleſs Lamb.) Now there is none can ſerve thoſe two Maſters, neither can any be heirs of theſe two kingdoms, but every one becomes his ſervant to whom he yields himſelf ſervant to obey, <hi>whether of ſin unto death, or of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience unto righteouſneſs,</hi> according as the Scripture de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares. All who obey the motion of the Lord in light and ſpirit, as he moves in the pure heart, become ſervants to the Lord, and ſo his work is brought forth into the world, which are works of righteouſneſs, as love, gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleneſs, patience, long-ſuffering, meekneſs, temperance, brotherly-kindneſs, humility, ſoberneſs, godlineſs, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto all as they would be done unto, and ſuch like fruits of righteouſneſs, which are a witneſſe againſt the unrighteouſneſſe of the world; and ſo are juſtified by God in ſpirit, and created in Chriſt Jeſus unto good works.</p>

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:103344:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>but puſs up into pride, and ſoto reject and deſpiſe the croſs of Chriſt; Such a knowledge had they who crucified the Son of God; and ſuch a knowledge have many in our age, but are perſecuting the appearance of Chriſt in his Saints. But this I ſay, none knows the Lord in Truth and Righteouſneſs but as he is revealed and manifeſted by his ſpirit within: <hi>for the ſpirit ſearcheth all things, yea the deep and hidden things of God.</hi> So all turn in your minds, and wait upon the Lord in the Light of his ſpirit that into his houſe you may be led, there to feed upon the living bread, &amp; ſoul-ſatisfying food (upon the hidden <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>) that which the world knowes not, but it is hid from them who be without, feeding amongſt the ſwine upon the husks and empty ſhadowes: but through love and mercy is revealed unto us, by the ſpirit of our God, and freely imparted unto you, to invite you to come in to our Fathers houſe, that you may eat with us and be ſatisfied, and praiſe the Lord with us in the Land of the living for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and ever.</p>
               <p>Oh my dearly beloved whom my ſoul longs and breaths after, whom in the truth, I dearly love, you are as a lively Epiſtle written in my heart, and I cannot forget you; go on in the Name and Power of the Lord, look not back, there is nothing behind you but death and darkneſs, for if any one draw back my ſoul ſhall have no pleaſure in them; therefore preſs on towards the mark, for the price of the high calling of God in Chriſt Jeſus, let not the rage of the heathen daunt you, knowing that it is our portion from that wicked and untoward generation to be reproached and reviled: <hi>But bleſſed are ye when men revile you, and reproach you, and perſecute you, and ſpeak all manuer of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil against you falſely for the Name of Chriſt, rejoyce and be exceeding glad for great is your reward in heaven, for ſo perſecuted they the Prophets, and the holy Apoſtles which which were before you; for if you were of the world, then
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:103344:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>would the world love you; but becauſe Chriſt Jeſus hath choſen you out of the world to be unto him a holy People, therefore do they</hi> (of the world who know not God) <hi>hate and revile you;</hi> but herein they are diſcovered and made manifeſt of what generation they are of, even of curſed <hi>Cains,</hi> who ſlew his brother, and where envy and rage is, they bear the mark of <hi>Cain,</hi> and ſo in this day of the Lord they are made manifeſt, for wherever perſecution is, it is a mark of the beaſt, that makes war againſt the Lamb, and it is not the mark or token of a Chriſtian, for the Nature of a Chriſtian is to ſuffer, and not to perſecute; therefore though ye ſuffer, and be reproached, yet be not diſcouraged, but put on the ſtrength of God, the armour of righteouſneſs whereby ye may all be kept ſafe, and the fiery darts of the wicked cannot pierce you.</p>

               <p>I do by the power of the Lord charge you all in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Lord (who profeſs the light) that you walk in the light, that every one may be in life and ſubſtance what you ſeem and profeſs your ſelves to be in words; that no hypocricy may be amongſt you, nor deceit, nor feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed love, nor ſeeming ſhew of feigned humility (for that is groſs and wicked abomination in the eyes of the pure God) but that indeed and in truth your love may flow forth one towards another without diſſimulation, for this is a true mark and token that you are the Lords choſen ones, for hereby ſhall all men know that you are fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers

Oh let it not be ſo with any of you but take up the Croſs willingly, and deſpiſe not the day of ſmall things, but whatſoever the light of Chriſt doth ſhew you to be evil or vain, caſt off and deny that evil and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, otherwiſe you cannot have true peace; for whilſt the wild nature is at liberty, and the unruly affections and luſts, they war againſt the ſoul; therefore ſaith Chriſt, <hi>take my yoke upon you and learn of me, I am meek and lowly in ſpirit, and you ſhall find reſt unto your ſouls.</hi> So the yoke of Chriſt being laid upon the wilde, it tames and brings down, and leavens the whole, and brings it into the nature of Chriſt, to meekneſs, and gentleneſs and lowlineſs of mind, and brokenneſs and tenderneſs of ſpirit, and ſo the fountain comes to be opened, and the pure ſtreams flowes forth to water the City of the living God: Therefore hide not the enemies of your peace in your own boſoms, neither let any preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice or evil thoughts lodge in your hearts, if you do, it will eat as a canker, untill the pure love be grown cold, and then comes a cloud of darkneſs, and hides the glory of the Son of Righteouſneſs, that it doth not ſhine in its brightneſs; and the earth will grow thick and ſtop the paſſage, that the ſtreams of love cannot run to water and

               <p>Therefore every one be faithful according to your mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and ſo in love and joy you will be kept in the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the ſpirit and bond of peace, and grow up in the vine as lively plants, and encreaſe in grace until we all come into the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man, even to the meaſure and ſtature of the fulneſs of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Take heed of reaſoning and conſulting withfleſh and blood, for that betrayes the ſimplicity, for many have been convinced of the Truth, and tender and honeſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, and a true love raiſed in them, by hearing of the ſound or declaration of Truth, but not abiding in that love to wait in the Croſs of Chriſt; but reaſoning with fleſh and blood, they have loſt their tenderneſs and ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity, and thoſe true deſires are choaked, and the iniquity got up, and their love grown cold; and ſuch though they may come to your meetings; Yet are dead, barren &amp; emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and poſſeſſed with a dull and ſluggiſh drowfie ſpirit; when others are feeding and ſitting in peace and reſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their own vine, having oyl in their veſſels, theſe care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ones are ready to ſtarve, and are weary in waiting, when words are not miniſtred; I ſay unto all ſuch, repent and fear the living God, and cauſe not the holy Name of our God to be blaſphemed amongſt the Heathen; return to your firſt love, and wait in patience until refreſhment come into your ſouls from the preſence of the Lord.</p>

               <p>So all of you in patience wait until the work of the Lord be perfected in you, turn not to the right hand, nor to the left, but keep in the plain way that leads to life eternal; meet often together accordingly as you have been directed, and when you are met together, wait upon God in his pure fear, with the loins of your minds girt up, that his voice you may hear, and his counſel receive and ſtand in, ſo ſhall your meetings be for the better and not for the worſe, and your ſtrength renewed, though there be no ſound of words ſpoken to your outward ears, yet coming once to taſte of the ſweetneſs of the love of God, you will find the union more pure, more dear and more neer then pen or tongue can declare; for if there be a ſweetneſs and a refreſhment to hear words (as I know there is, when they are ſpoken from the pure life and ſpirit of the Lord) then much more is there ſweetneſs and more pure refreſhment in the ſpirit of the Lord from whence the words do proceed, and all words and writings given forth from the ſpirit, are to bring to the ſpirits worſhip; this is the ſum and the end of all the ſhadows and carnal ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervances, to know God, and to worſhip him in Spirit and in truth; according as it is written, <hi>for there is no man knowes the things of God but the ſpirit of God;</hi> ſo without the ſpirit guiding and teaching, all words and writings will but little avail, onely ſerve to add to the condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all thoſe that are hearers, but are not doers of the Word of God.</p>
